# streamlit_menu_pkg

In streamlit, creating a custom menu takes a little while. With the help of this menu component, users may quickly construct a menu that meets their needs (Expandible or collapsible). This menu item is fully sized in both height and width. Therefore, users may put it anywhere they like in the streamlit window Ex. sidebar, left, right, or center. Users must provide menu information and menu styles in the specified format. The user must modify some of the streamlit's built-in styles if they desire to add a menu component to the sidebar. This menu component will provide the user with the selected menu item and streamlit callback feature. so that based on the chosen menu item, he or she can take the appropriate action.
